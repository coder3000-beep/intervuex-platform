Previous Question: ${previousQuestion}

Candidate's Answer: ${candidateAnswer}

Questions Already Asked (DO NOT REPEAT):
${questionHistory.map((q, i) => `${i + 1}. ${q}`).join('\n')}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate a COMPLETELY UNIQUE question - DO NOT repeat or rephrase any previous question
2. Difficulty: ${difficultyLevel} - make it ${difficultyLevel === 'hard' ? 'challenging with edge cases' : difficultyLevel === 'medium' ? 'moderately complex' : 'foundational'}
3. Build upon their previous answer to test deeper understanding
4. Focus on ${candidateProfile.skills?.[0] || 'technical'} skills
5. Include specific scenarios or edge cases
6. Test problem-solving and critical thinking
7. Make it progressively harder than question ${currentQuestionNumber - 1}

Generate ONE unique, ${difficultyLevel} technical question that:
- Tests advanced concepts if answer was good
- Probes weak areas if answer was poor
- Includes real-world scenarios
- Requires detailed technical knowledge
- Is completely different from all previous questions

Return ONLY the question text, nothing else.`;
